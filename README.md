# androidworking

This is my introduction to mobile/Android development project and one of my first Java projects.

Core aim is to learn about Android development on Android Studio.
Secondary aims are to utilize Github and other dev tools further.

Whether I can actually create a working app remains up for debate.

If anyone reads this, let me know if you have any advice.
